# LotteryDraws Application

Setup:
Project was created with Visual Studio 2019, with Angular and .Net Core compatability installed.
This should be able to be run directly from VS, launching the website and MVC/API backend at the same time without issue.

Installed Angular CLI version:
CLI 9.0.1
Node 12.15.0

Improvements required:
The front-page should be styled more effectively, though Bootstrap makes it presentable at minimum for a prototype
Setup Teamcity/Octopus variables and transforms for different environments (ie TattsUrl -> Prod version where applicable)
Further error handling in backend/frontend for improved resiliency
Unit tests on Angular front-end to check appearances should be developed
Further unit testing on the backend services
Pagination for results, customisable number of results field (depending on requirement, may not want users to adjust)

Notes:
The HTTP Helper method should be tested incidentally through use of the Tatts data service
Tests utilise NUnit
Dependancy injection is utilised for ease of use & development
Tested primarily on Firefox 80.0.1 (64-bit) (should adapt to mobile with bootstrap)
